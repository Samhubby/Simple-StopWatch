# Simple-StopWatch
I created this simple stopwatch web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The stopwatch displays minutes, seconds, and milliseconds and allows you to start, pause, resume, and reset the timer. For styling, I used the Tailwind CSS framework.

The stopwatch functionality is implemented in JavaScript, with precise time tracking using the performance.now() method. You can interact with the stopwatch by clicking on buttons to control its behavior.

Please note that this repository includes only the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files necessary to run the stopwatch. Node modules and Tailwind CSS configuration files are not included
